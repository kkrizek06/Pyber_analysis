# Pyber_analysis

**Overview of the analysis:** 
  
   This module had us examine data from a ride sharing service name Pyber. We created a summary that compares data based on city type. This summary compares total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver, for rural, suburban and urban areas. We then used matplotlib to create a line graph comparing the total weekly fares for each city type. 
 
**Results:** 
  
   There is a large gap between Urban and the other city types. Urban has by far way more rides, and drivers. Urban has the lowest fare averages per ride, and per driver. Rural has the largest averages but the lowest total rides, and drivers.

   This chart is consistent with the summary. Showing that the weekly fares for Urban city type is greater than the others. This chart also shows that there is a significant decrease in fares the last week of March. This decrease is seen in both the Urban and Suburban city types however, the Urban city type was greater effected. This chart also shows that the Rural city type is more consistent. The Rural regression line is flat compared to the other types.

**Summary:**

The disparities in the data are caused by Urban, Suburban, and Rural lifestyles. Urban areas provide high traffic situations, where public transportation and ride-sharing services are often used. With such densely populated areas its common for people to not have a vehicle of their own. This results in many more people participating in ride-sharing services in the Urban area. This also explains why Urban areas have the lowest fare average numbers. Although they are getting a higher volume of rides the distance needed to travel is much less when living in the city. One business recommendation that I have is to find a way to increase the Average Fare per Driver in Urban areas. By increasing the fare by a few cents, or maybe charging more a flat rate for rides under a certain mileage can increase this average amount. Another business recommendation is to increase the number of rides in Rural areas. Possibly this can be done through advertising, promoting the benefits of using ride-sharing services in rural areas. Lastly, I recommend looking into promoting riders in Suburban areas to use ride-sharing services to get to the city. To summarize, I recommend increasing the Urban Fare per driver average, Increasing total ride numbers for both Suburban and Rural areas.
